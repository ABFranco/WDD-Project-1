            <p>[Verse 1]
                Hello, it's me
                I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
                To go over everything
                They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
                Hello, can you hear me?
                I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
                When we were younger and free
                I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

                [Pre-Chorus 1]
                There's such a difference between us
                And a million miles

                [Chorus]
                Hello from the other side
                I must've called a thousand times
                To tell you, I'm sorry for everything that I've done
                But when I call, you never seem to be home
                Hello from the outside
                At least, I can say that I've tried
                To tell you, I'm sorry for breaking your heart
                But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

                [Verse 2]
                Hello, how are you?
                It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
                I hope that you're well
                Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?

                [Pre-Chorus 2]
                It's no secret that the both of us
                Are running out of time

                [Chorus]
                So hello from the other side
                I must've called a thousand times
                To tell you, I'm sorry for everything that I've done
                But when I call, you never seem to be home
                Hello from the outside
                At least, I can say that I've tried
                To tell you, I'm sorry for breaking your heart
                But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

                [Bridge]
                (Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
                Ooh, anymore
                (Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
                Ooh, anymore
                (Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
                Ooh, anymore
                (Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
                Anymore

                [Chorus]
                Hello from the other side
                I must've called a thousand times
                To tell you, I'm sorry for everything that I've done
                But when I call, you never seem to be home
                Hello from the outside
                At least, I can say that I've tried
                To tell you, I'm sorry for breaking your heart
                But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore</p>
